# Mantain consistency of units!!
# Both board data is related to the reconstructed area that is to be requested :)
board_position: [48,51,0]  # upper left corner (same units) (asume Z is constant in all board)
# board_position: [0,0,1]
board_size: [324,220]    # x,y size of the board

# Side size of the Aruco marker
aruco_side: 40

# Configuration of each marker with its associated shape
# Aruco position in the sheet from upper left corner (same units)
# Asumes that z is constant in same aruco
